## Feature

### What is Lighthouse?
[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) is a tool built and open sourced by Google, which is to improve the quality of web apps.

### Lighthouse Compare?
The goal of Ligthouse Compare is to monitor and keep web appâ€™s quality by running Lighthouse in CI and compare reports so that developers can see how a particular changeset influenced the score or any of the audits.

## Installation
```
$ npm install lighthouse-compare lighthouse --save
```

## Usage
1. Use lighthouse-compare in your test script
```JavaScript
// test.js
const cp = require('child_process');
const compare = require('lighthouse-compare');

// build and start to serve locally
cp.execSync('yarn build', { stdio: 'inherit' });
const proc = cp.spawn('yarn', ['serve']);

// run lighthouse analysing
compare.run({ url: 'http://localhost:5001' });
```

2. Run script in CI
A `.travis.yml` example:
```
# need following config for running chrome
sudo: required
dist: trusty

# other config

# run your test script
script: node ./test.js

# add chrome addon to run lighthouse
addons:
  chrome: stable
```

3. You should be able to see the report link in the CI logs.
